# ChatPDF: AI-Powered Document Querying with Streamlit and Gemini

This project allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content using the power of Google's Gemini models and Langchain.  It leverages Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, PyPDF2 for PDF extraction, and FAISS for efficient vector storage.

**Try it out here:** [https://llm-pdf-reader.streamlit.app/](https://llm-pdf-reader.streamlit.app/)

## Key Features

*   **Upload PDF Documents:** Easily upload single or multiple PDF files for analysis.
*   **Ask Questions:** Pose questions related to the content of the uploaded documents.
*   **AI-Powered Answers:** Get accurate and relevant answers generated by Google's Gemini AI models.
*   **Source Attribution:** View the specific sections of the documents used to generate the answer, promoting transparency and trust.
*   **Chat History:** Maintains a conversation history within the app, allowing for follow-up questions.
*   **Streamlit Interface:**  Provides a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
*   **Langchain:**  A framework for building applications powered by language models.
*   **Google Gemini Models:**  Leverages `gemini-2.0-flash` and `text-embedding-004` for question answering and embeddings.
*   **PyPDF2:**  For extracting text from PDF documents.
*   **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):**  For efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
*   **dotenv:** For managing API keys and sensitive information.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KrishChordiya/llm-pdf-reader.git
    cd llm-pdf-reader
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Key:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.  (It's important to name it `.env` precisely)
    *   Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        ```
        **Note:** Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your actual API key.  **DO NOT** commit your `.env` file to version control.

5.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will open the application in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  **Upload Documents:** Use the file uploader in the sidebar to upload one or more PDF documents.
2.  **Process Documents:** Click the "Process" button to process the uploaded documents. This will create a vectorstore for efficient question answering.
3.  **Ask Questions:**  Type your question in the chat input box.
4.  **View Answer:** The AI-generated answer will be displayed in the chat window.
5.  **Source Attribution:** Use the toggle button to enable viewing of sources in the chat interface. Expand the sections to see the source documents used to create the answer.

## Code Explanation

*   **`app.py`:** The main Streamlit application file.
    *   **`get_pdf_text(pdf_docs)`:** Extracts text from PDF documents using PyPDF2.
    *   **`get_text_chunks(text)`:** Splits the extracted text into smaller chunks for better vector embedding.
    *   **`get_vectorstore(text_chunks)`:** Creates a FAISS vectorstore from the text chunks using Google's `text-embedding-004` model.  The Google API key is loaded from Streamlit secrets or the `.env` file.
    *   **`get_retrival_chain(query)`:** Creates a retrieval chain using Langchain and Google's `gemini-2.0-flash` model to answer questions based on the vectorstore. This function now creates a retrieval chain and invokes it.
    *   **`main()`:** The main function that sets up the Streamlit interface, handles file uploads, processes documents, and manages the chat interface.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the Python packages required to run the application.
